### 💼 Projects & Activities

#### 📌 Auto-Brightness Control System with Dual Raspberry Pi  
*Embedded system for adaptive indoor lighting*  
- Designed a real-time brightness control system using **dual Raspberry Pi** nodes.  
- Measured ambient & indoor illuminance + distance via **ultrasonic sensor**, dynamically adjusting LED brightness in **4 levels**.  
- Implemented sensor fusion logic and PWM-based dimming control.

#### 📌 Multimodal Hateful Meme Classification (Kaggle-style)  
*Fusing vision + language to detect toxic content*  
- Enhanced low-res meme dataset by replacing images with **high-resolution versions** for improved feature extraction.  
- Built multimodal classifier: **ResNet18 (image)** + **BERT (text)** → late fusion architecture.  
- Boosted performance using **learning rate scheduling**, **dropout regularization**, and balanced sampling.

#### 📌 Ultrasound Image Denoising via Signal Processing  
*Signal-domain restoration of medical ultrasound images*  
- Analyzed noisy ultrasound signals in **time/frequency domain** using MATLAB (sampling freq. based FFT).  
- Designed **custom high-pass filter** based on signal characteristics to suppress low-freq noise.  
- Successfully restored structural clarity in output images — applicable to diagnostic preprocessing.
